    <h2>ELECTRICITY AND ELECTRIC FIELD</h2>
    <p>Electrostatics is a branch of science that deals with the phenomena that arises fros static electric charges. Charges were first 
        grouped into positive and negative by Benjamin Franklin from year[1706-1709]
        <br>Like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract each other this can be seen by using simple scientific experiments
        if we rub a plastic ruler with fur and a glass rod with silk the plastic ruler will become negatively charged while the 
        glass rod becomes positively charged so if we try to bring them together we will notice some sort of attraction between them
        <br><h3>the law of conservation of electric charge states , that the net charge produced during any process is 'ZERO'
            </h3>
            <h3>CONDUCTOR: a conductor is a material that allows the flow of electric charge throug it <br>
                INSULATORS: An insulator is a material that does not easily allow elecrtic charge to flow through it
            </h3>
