            <h2>
                This website was created by a team of student software engineers at the great OSUN STATE UNIVERSITY with the sole aim
                of connecting scholars together to rub minds together and interact with the developers to foster new improvements in this wwebsite
                . For some of us this website does not look too professional ,well it was a personal project but we felt others can also
                benefit from the idea. For more improvements we will need feedbacks from the users ao that we can see the areas thatn need some touches
                and we hope you can help us with this. And most importantly the website is for those that really want to have first class 5.0 CGPA
                and trust us this is very possible with if we can all cooperate . "The developers are also 100level students trying to make a difference"

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">FOR US HERE AT LEARN-ED WE FEEL THAT TRUE SUCCESS ACTUALLY COMES FROM IMPACTING PEOPLES LIVES POSITIVELY.
            THATS THE REASON WHY WE WANT TO BE A PART OF YOUR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY THIS SEMESTER AND WE HOPE TO GIVE YOU OUR BEST
            , TO ENSURE THAT OUR DREAM OF BEING A FIRST CLASS STUDENT CAN COME TRUE . AND WE BELIEVE THAT WITH HARD WORK, DEDICATION AND ALMIGHTY GOD ON OUR SIDE OUR DREAMS ARE ACHIEVEABLE.
